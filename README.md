[bot.html](bot.html) contains a [customisation](https://conjointly.com/faq/respondent-interface-customisation/) for the Conjointly survey interface that will behave like a respondent randomly populating your survey.

It is useful for testing your survey in case you make very complicated logic or questionnaire flow.
